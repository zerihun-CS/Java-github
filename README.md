GitHub is an online software development platform.
It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects.
Since its founding in 2008, GitHub has acquired millions of users and established itself as a go-to platform for collaborative software projects. This free service comes with several helpful features for sharing code and working with others in real time.

On top of its code-related functions, GitHub encourages users to build a personal profile and brand for themselves. You can visit anyoneâ€™s profile and see what projects they own and contribute to. This makes GitHub a type of social network for programmers and fosters a collaborative approach to software and website development.


# how it works 
GitHub users create accounts, upload files, and create coding projects. But the real work of GitHub happens when users begin to collaborate.

While anyone can code independently, teams of people build most development projects. Sometimes these teams are all in one place at once time, but more often they work asynchronously. There are many challenges to creating collaborative projects with distributed teams. GitHub makes this process much simpler in a few different ways.
